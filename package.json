  "description": "The topology viewer depicts the secondary structure of a protein in a 2D representation, taking into account the interactions of these secondary structure elements. This leads to a consistent display of sheets and domains in the structure. For PDB entries with multiple copies of a protein, the best chain is used. The topology viewer also depicts value-added annotation from SIFTS including residue-level mapping to UniProt, sequence families (Pfam), structure domains (SCOP, CATH) and structure quality from wwPDB validation reports.",
